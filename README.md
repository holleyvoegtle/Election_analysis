## Election Audit Summary
This project was a good example of using data to get information on a local election. Knowing who won an election is only part of the story. We also were able to find out what percentages and numbers each candidate received. From there, information was further extracted to find out the voter percentages of the surrounding counties and how many people voted per county. If were were to look further into this information, I would suggest looking into data the could see how race and gender played a part in the election and who they voted for in each county. A second script that could be run, if we had more data, could be age of the voters and what percentage voted for which candidate.
